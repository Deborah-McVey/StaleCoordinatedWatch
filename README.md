# Ruby on Replit

This is a template to get you started with Ruby on Replit. It's ready to go so you can just hit run and start coding!

## Running the repl

Simply hit run! You can edit the run command from the `.replit` file.

## Installing packages

To add packages to your repl, we recommend using the Replit packager interface in the left sidebar or using `bundle install` in the shell. Check out the [Bundle docs here](https://bundler.io/guides/getting_started.html).

**Warning: Avoid using `gem install` to add packages.**

Beacuse Ruby repls use [Bundle](https://bundler.io/) under the hood to provide a consistent environment that tracks and installs the exact gems and versions needed, we recommend using `bundle install` instead of `gem install`, which may not work as expected.

## Help

If you need help you might be able to find an answer on our [docs](https://docs.replit.com) page. Feel free to report bugs and give us feedback [here](https://replit.com/support).

9. Super Fizz Buzz
Create a Ruby script that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz". For numbers that are multiples of seven, print "Super". For numbers that are multiples of both three and seven, print "FizzSuper". For numbers that are multiples of both five and seven, print "BuzzSuper". For numbers that are multiples of three, five, and seven, print "FizzBuzzSuper".
